Computer Programming Final Project Proposal

SchedulBot:
A discord bot that allows you to
input your schedule and will message you info about your classes. 
When a class ends, the bot will tell everyone in the server what 
class they have, what block it is, what room it's in, and what
members of the server you have it with.
